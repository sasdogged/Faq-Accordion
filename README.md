# Frontend Mentor - FAQ accordion solution

This is a solution to the [FAQ accordion challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/faq-accordion-wyfFdeBwBz). Frontend Mentor challenges help you improve your coding skills by building realistic projects. 


## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
- Navigate the questions and hide/show answers using keyboard navigation alone
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles


### What I learned

Learnt another way to better use the CSS content property and displaying a background with it. 
Also understood more about SVGs.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.question::after{
  content: url('./assets/images/icon-plus.svg');
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://coolors.co/) - This helped me in choosing a color for the question :hover and :focus state.
